### Campaign Companion
###### _Based of 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons_

Campaign Companion is a mobile app for new Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) players and Dungeon Masters (DMs).
This app is meant for custom campaigns where the story and world does not need to follow the official DnD examples.
All entries are manual.

Feedback:
>I think as a player viewing character stuff is the most useful, and having access to spells and what they do. Also editing character stats so you can keep track of them in combat  
1- characters  
2- handbook  
3-map  
4-story   
5-calendar  
6-dice  
The calendar is a good idea tho!  

>They're all important!  
Oh also having something to keep track of npcs and places we've been would be super useful. Like being able to drop a pin on a map?

>Character info 1   
summary of episode (with option for players to add comments) 2  
Create/update maps 4  
Create/update characters 2  
Option to limit what players can use so its doesn't get overly complicated 3  
Viewing map 3  
Viewing characters 5 - I don't think other characters should be able to see what other characters have  
Viewing story so far 3  
Calendar to book next game 2  
Virtual dice 2  
Access to handbook stuff (via the api) 3  
Maps on Mobile? Seems too small.  

>Place to view/update/delete character info 4  
Enter summary of episode (with option for players to add comments) 2  
Create/update maps 1  
Create/update characters 1  
What should EVERY one have access to?  
Viewing map 1  
Viewing characters 3  
Viewing story so far 2  
Calendar to book next game 3  
Virtual dice 3  
Theres already heaps of really good (free) tools for that (viewing characters)  
I mean technically it would be somthing youd already have if you were converting to use this new app  
In my mind I would be picking up this app to supliment the dnd I already do
